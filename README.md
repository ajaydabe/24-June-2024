# Streamlined Python Flask App Deployment with Docker & CI/CD Pipeline


### This project demonstrates a streamlined approach to deploying a Python Flask application.

#### It leverages the following technologies:

**Python Flask**: A lightweight web framework used to build the application.

**Docker**: Creates a containerized environment for your application, ensuring consistency and portability.

**Docker Hub**: A public/private registry for sharing container images.

**Git**: Version control system for managing code changes.

**GitHub**: Cloud-based Git repository hosting platform with collaboration features.

**Webhook**: Triggers an automated build process in Jenkins upon code push.

**Jenkins Pipeline**: A continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline that automates building, testing, and deploying the Docker image to Docker Hub.

## Benefits:

**Automated Deployments**: Streamlined workflow reduces manual intervention and human error.

**Consistent Environment**: Docker containers ensure consistent behavior across development, testing, and production environments.

**Scalability**: Dockerized applications are easily scalable by adding more containers.

**Version Control**: Git provides a track record of code changes and facilitates collaboration.

**Public/Private Image Sharing**: Docker Hub allows for easy sharing of images (publicly or privately).
